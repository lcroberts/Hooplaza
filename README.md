# Hooplaza
A project for CSC340-01 at UNCG for Fall 2023.
HooPlaza is a neighborhood social networking service. It is designed as a community hub for events, community projects, and clubs. The main objective of this app is to connect community members and ease car-dependency by allowing users to join in activities that are close-by, instead of far away from their neighborhood. HooPlaza is a Web Application that can be reached via the internet, on a web browser. It is designed to allow users to connect to an admin to create a new community and, as a moderator, appoint other users as moderators and keep the community organized. It allows users to join clubs and RSVP to events they may not have otherwise known about.
